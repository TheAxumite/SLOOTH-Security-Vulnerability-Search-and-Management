# SLOOTH: Security Vulnerability Search and Management
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/Bc-pdPVGrOw
#### Description: Slooth is a comprehensive security vulnerability search and management system designed specifically for organizations that want to stay ahead of the latest security threats. Utilizing the python NVD API wrapper and REST API, Slooth performs queries specifically for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), providing a unique identifier known as the CVE ID for stakeholders to discuss and research specific exploits.

### **Key Feautres**
- Web application written in Python 3 with Flask web server and HTML, CSS, JavaScript front-end
- Utilizes OpenCVE's REST API for querying CVEs
- 9 database tables to record company information, user activities, vendor and product information, vulnerability assignments, added CVEs, engineering notes, temporary accounts, and all user accounts
- Python libraries including Nvdlib, datetime, secrets, RE, flask_session, flask_wtf, json, string, Datetime, Jinja2, and Functools

**Company Table**- Records Registering organization’s information
 
**System Log Table**- Records all user activities
 
**Vendor Table**- Records vendor names in company's inventory
 
**Product Table**- Records vendor systems in company's inventory
 
**Work_log Table** – Records vulnerabilities assigned to engineers
 
**Added_CVE Table**- Records Vulnerabilities added to inventory
 
**Comments Table** – Records engineering notes for CVE
 
**Temp_account Table**- Records new accounts with temporary passwords or password reset accounts
 
**Users Table** – Records all user accounts
 
### Python Libraries:
 
 -*Nvdlib*(Python API wrapper utilizing the REST API provided by NIST for the National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
 
 -*datetime*
 
 -*secrets*
 
 -*RE(regular expressions)*
 
 -*flask_session*
 
 -*flask_wtf* 
 
 -*json* 
 
 -*string*
 
 -*Datetime*
 
 -*Jinja2*
 
 -*Functools*


### **Getting Started**
1. Create a user account, and it's recommended to also create an engineer account for IT security personnel. A temporary password will be sent to the user's email after account creation.
2. Add all systems in the environment (by vendor and product) to the account for tracking.
3. Start searching for CVEs using one of the multiple query options available.
4. Add relevant CVEs to your organization's inventory using an administrator account.
5. Assign CVEs to engineers through the ticketing system and track progress through the dashboard.

### **Searching for CVEs**
- Type the CVE number (e.g. CVE-1999-0001) for a specific CVE search.
- Search by date range (e.g. Startdate: 01/10/2022 Enddate:03/01/2022) for all CVEs within the specified time period (maximum 120 days).
- Add keywords before the start date for specific vulnerability or system searches (e.g. SQL injection Startdate: 01/10/2022 Enddate:03/01/2022).

### **Adding systems**

Organizations can use Slooth as a ticketing system to track and assign CVEs to security engineers. The ticket tracks the assignment date, due date, and work logs. An administrator can view all unassigned vulnerabilities in the dashboard and assign them by selecting options. Engineers can see their assigned CVEs in their dashboard and input work logs and close the ticket once the vulnerability is fixed.

### **Dashboard**

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your organization's vulnerabilities and their status, as well as the number of tickets assigned to each engineer.


**Future Updates**

-Ability for Admins to reset passwords

-A news feed dashboard that shows all recently released CVEs relevent to Client based on their System

-Ability to send email/text notification of CVEs to a group or email

-Revamp ticket assignement to include groups and not just individuals

-Switch to none CS50 SQL of SQL Alchemey

-Deploy on a server

-Create an app as an alternative frontend

-Expand on ticketing form to allow uploads of work files and expand user input

-Revamp dashboard to include other stastical details that is helpful to the organiziation(average time to resolution, create scorecard based on severity of CVE among other variables to weigh score, breakdown of CVEs based on severity)

-Better search alograthim for more accurate search results

-"Bypassing" API Date range limitations
